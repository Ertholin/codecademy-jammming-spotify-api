# The purpose of the project
In this project, I build a React web application called Jammming. I am using React's knowledge components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

# Deploy App
- In this section, you will use surge to deploy your Jammming project.

You will start by installing surge globally.

In your console, run

npm install --global surge
BEFORE YOU PROCEED, you need to think of a domain name with the following format:

SOME_NAME.surge.sh
SOME_NAME can be replaced with anything you like

Next, you need to replace or add this URI to two locations in your project (make sure to add the https:// before your domain name in both locations)

FOR EXAMPLE

https://SOME_NAME.surge.sh
In Spotify.js set redirectURI to your new domain
In your Spotify application, add your new domain as a redirect URI
Back in the command line. from the Jammming project's root directory, run

npm run build
cd into the build directory and run the command

ยง surge
Follow the steps on the screen. Change the domain value to your new URI.

Congrats! You've just deployed a React App that queries the Spotify
